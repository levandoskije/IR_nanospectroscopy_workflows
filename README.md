# Orange workflows for s-SNOM nanospectroscopy data processing

In this repository you find Orange workflows for processing s-SNOM data. An example dataset including point spectra, spectral linescan and hyperspectral data is provided for educational purposes. All data provided was measured at a synchrotron light source and are a courtesy of Feres *et al.* [1].

## Guidlines for downloading and oppening workflows:

1. Go to https://github.com/raul-freitas/imbuia_workflows
2. Click on **Code** and then **Download ZIP**. This can take some time...
3. Select the folder and extract;
4. Open the Orange app (for Orange installation, access the links [Quasar](https://quasar.codes) or [Orange](https://orangedatamining.com). It is mandatory to have the **Spectroscopy** Add-On installed for this kind of data processing.);

## Broadband s-SNOM nanospectroscopy measuring modes
s-SNOM is a scanning probe ultramicroscopy modality that combines AFM and IR-visible microscopy. For the case of s-SNOM operating with broadband sources, the technique enables nanoscale spectroscopy (Figure a). As a scanning technique, it can operate point-spectral analysis (Figure b), spectral linescan (Figure c) and hyperspectral imaging (Figure d).

For data processing of measurents of different s-SNOM modes, we provide the following Orange workflows:

 - [Point Spectrum](point_spectrum/):

	This is just a spectrum measured in just one position.

	This data has a full spectrum data, wavenumber approximately 600 cm<sup>-1</sup> up to 2000 cm<sup>-1</sup>, but in only one pixel.

 - [Linescan](spectral_linescan/):

 	In this case, a full spectrum of each pixel along a path choose is during the experiment.


 - [Hyperspectral Image](hyperspectral_map/):

 	In the last type is a full spectrum on each pixel inside an area.
